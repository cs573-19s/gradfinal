**Aim:** This paper sets out to provide an overall outline of the methods used to go from raw chromosome capture data (Hi-C or 3C) data to an interpertation of results in a clear, accessible manner that can be followed as the components of each step evolve over time. By doing so, they strive to provide a template for analysis that is flexible to fit variations in protocol while pointing out what must be taken into consideration for each step.

**Conclusion:** The researchers go through each step from raw data through analysis and interpertation, pointing out what is important in each step and where there is room for growth within the field. For example, point interactions require adequate data resolution as well as biologically reasons to assume one may find a point interaction to substantiate analyses that seek real point interactions, which are otherwise difficult to distinguish from experimental noise. 


**How does what they're saying inform this project:** The scale of the intereactions we are looking for/at is within the real of point interactions, so the context requirements for analyzing these data will need to be applied to visualizual exploration as well.
