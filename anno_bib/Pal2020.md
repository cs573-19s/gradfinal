**Title:** HiCBricks: building blocks for efficient handling of large Hi-C datasets

**Venue:** Bioinformatics

**Year:** 2020

**Citations:** 5

**Aim:** The authors address the issue of analyzing large, high-resolution HI-C datasets that are the result in the improvements in technology as well as increased adoption of chromatin capture techniques. They aim to address the ability to manipulate, analyze, and visualize such datasets by providing an adaptable, efficient R/Bioconductor framework within which to conduct the operations necessary.

**Conclusion:** The authors consider available tools, both for high-resolution datasets as well as those that provide lower level data manipulation functions. The overlap between these two sets of tools is lacking. This gap is the one the researchers fill with the functions available in the HiCBricks package, allowing bioinformaticians to build custom pipelines or integrate these large datasets into existing pipelines without maxing out their computational resources.


**How does what they're saying inform this project:** 
Given the questions our visualization method aims to address would be best suited with high resolution Hi-C data, higher than what we used, this package is of particular interest to us going forward. While it was not used in the current implementation of our method, we will use it when we have a higher resolution dataset suitable to the context of our broader research questions.
