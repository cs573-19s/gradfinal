The aim of the paper was to introduce a tool, a JavaScript application programming interface (API) to integrate network visualizations from the Java-based Cytoscape platform, which is Java based, into a standard language used for programming web-based applications or to create such networks independently of the original platform. As a visualization tool, the modes used for encoding are key, so this API uses cascading stylesheets (CSS) to allow users to standardize styling across visualizations. Examples of use of this tool are already available in many commonly used biological data platforms such as as RCyjs Bioconductor, a package often used in bioinformatics research.


The type of article cite did not include any results or a conclusion. The purpose of the paper was to introduce Cytoscape.js as a tool within the context of existing tools. The paper highlighted the current features of the API as well as potential future directions. It also emphasized the open-source nature of the project, eliciting suggestions from the reader for ways to improve the tool and noting that it is open for expansion via community constructed expansions.


This paper presents a Javascript API that provides a framework on which the type of visualization method presented by our research can be built. Because it is already integrated into multiple tools used for related purposes, it would be logical for future implementation to be constructed as an extension of Cytoscape.js. The capability of Cytoscape (the Java based application *(citation?!)*) to export networks in a JSON format, which is Cytoscape.js compatible, lends itself to the possibility the D3.JS API could be used to develop visualizations if the Cytoscape.js API is unable to provide the desired features.
