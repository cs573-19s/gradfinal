**Title:** GrapHi-C: graph-based visualization of Hi-C datasets

**Venue:** BMC Research Notes

**Year:** 2018

**Aim:** 
The authors of this paper seek a visualization that more intuitively represents the physical interactions detected by Hi-C and other chromatin capture methods. The goal of such a visualization is to enhance pattern recognition. They propose doing this using a graph representation of contact matrix via a protocol that uses existing tools; chromosome loci will be represented by nodes and edges will indicate interactions between those nodes.

**Conclusion:** 
Pre-existing data was used to test the methodogy. The ability of the visualization protocol to work as proposed was dependent on the data itself. For example, the juxtoposition of the *cis-* and *trans-* chromosomal interactions for wild-type yeast with the the heatmaps demonstrates the increased clarity of interaction patterns using GrapHi-C over heatmaps. However, this gain is largely lost for the mutant type. Comparing wild and mutant via heatmaps does not indicate a drastic difference but the GrapHi-C method clearly demonstrates a distinction between the wild and mutant types.  As an additional benfit, this visualization portrays regions where multiple-way interactions may be detected. Therefore, while not necessarily the best stand-alone tool for visualizing Hi-C data, this protocol adds beneficial perspectives for exploring this datatype.

**How does what they're saying inform this project:** 
What the researchers demonstrate is a clear need for different perspectives when looking at interaction types as each has the potential to highlight new features of chromatin organization. For example, Heatmaps do not show everything that exists to be seen, even within the space of *cis-* chromosomal interactions; but, this new protocol dramatically depicts the differences in interactions between the wild and mutant types.
