Description:

Educational access remains uneven in China. Students born into affluent families generally have greater access to high-quality education than those from lower income backgrounds. So we decided to create a map of China and find the relationship between the data by comparing the education funds and the number of students in each province. And visulize the education funding \& undergraduate population in different area in a China map from 1993 to 2017. Then this paper will discuss how to create maps and data connections, and finally, show and discuss the final results and the goals that we want to accomplish in the future.
