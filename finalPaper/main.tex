%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
The objective of this paper is to inform people of the dangers of hurricanes. Over the years many people have died to hurricanes and there have been many damages caused by hurricanes. This paper takes a look at hurricane paths, death count, damage count, and evacuation types of larger scale hurricanes in the Atlantic ocean. It was seen from the information gathered that people may underestimate hurricanes and may not prepare for hurricanes well due to the large amounts of death and damages accumulated over time. It is estimated that if we took all the money accumulated in damages, we could produce  ___ hurricane proof rooms.

This paper aims to get people to understand that hurricanes are unpredictable and that people should not waste time in evacuating when told to do so and to prepare ahead of time. This paper will talk a little bit about the background of hurricane related information and then the methodology of how an animation was created in order to tell a story about hurricanes. Finally, the results found will be stated and discussed along with a final conclusion made about the project.
