%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
The objective of this paper is to inform people of the dangers of hurricanes through a story animation. Over the years many people have died to hurricanes and there has been lots of damages. This paper takes a look at hurricane paths, death count, damage count, and evacuation types of large scale hurricanes in the Atlantic ocean. From the information gathered, it was concluded that people may underestimate hurricanes and may not prepare for hurricanes well enough due to the large amounts of death and damages accumulated over time. It is important to note that the number of deaths has significantly reduced over the years however the amount of damages has increase significantly as well. It is estimated that if we took all the money accumulated in damages, we could produce over 120 million hurricane proof rooms. The main message that this story animation is that people should prepare for hurricanes much more and to not underestimate hurricanes. This paper aims to get people to understand that hurricanes are unpredictable. This paper will talk about the background of hurricane related information as well as the methodology of how this animation was created in order to tell the story about hurricanes ignorance. Finally, the results found were stated and discussed along with a final conclusion made about the project.
